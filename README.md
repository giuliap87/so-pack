## Motivation
The aim of this project was to get familiar with the Next JS framework and build a fully functioning website in React.  

## Description
The website is for a French company that can help you creating your own perfumes and cosmetics. From the filling to the packaging and delivery. 
The website has a main page with some information about the company and their products and 2 other pages, one about packaging and one describing the full creating process and the services they provide. 

See the website at: https://so-pack.vercel.app
